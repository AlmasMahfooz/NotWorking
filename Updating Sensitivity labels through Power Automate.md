Update File Properties action in SharePoint, available within Power Automate, allows you to modify metadata associated with files stored in document libraries.

But Update file properties don't provide a way to update any of the fields related to labels.
'OData__DisplayName' is the field name for Sensitivity data information, two other fields are Label ID Label Display Name.
Sensitivity/OData_DisplayName and SensitivityLabelName both contain the value of label, in this case it is "Internal".
"{SensitivityLabelId}": "ec7c3683-4e14-4efa-b36b-9868c5883c6f",
"{SensitivityLabelName}": "Internal"

Tried Send an HTTP request to SharePoint but it seems it doesn't recognize the label fields.
Header code

json('{"Accept":"application/json;odata=verbose","Content-Type":"application/json;odata=verbose","X-HTTP-Method":"MERGE","IF-MATCH":"*"}')

When added sensitivity label ID for update it gives error
Action 'Send_an_HTTP_request_to_SharePoint' failed: Column 'SensitivityLabelId' does not exist. It may have been deleted by another user.

While searching for error, overall suggestion is that Sensitivity Labels fields are related to Purview and could be update through Microsoft Graph API's assignSensitivityLabel or Powershell.
I also tried using Graph API POST action but still getting errors and someone somewhere mentioned that its usage is metered and need to enable something at the end of Microsoft Graph.
Never tried Powershell solution, detail steps are explained in there [link ](https://sposcripts.com/assign-sensitivity-labels-in-sharepoint/)
